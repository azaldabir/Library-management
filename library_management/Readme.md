## Introduction

This Django project provides a comprehensive library management system. It allows you to manage books, patrons, and library staff efficiently.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- Python (version x.x)
- Django (version x.x)
- Git (for cloning the repository)

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project on your local machine.

### Clone the Repository

First, clone the project repository using the following command:

```bash
git clone -b master git@github.com:azaldabir/Library-management.git
```

### Setting up a Virtual Environment

Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd Library-management
```

Create a virtual environment (replace 'venv' with your preferred name):

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

Activate the virtual environment:

**On Windows:**

```bash
venv\Scripts\activate
```

**On macOS and Linux:**

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

### Installing Requirements

With your virtual environment activated, install the project's dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the Project

Now, you can run the Django development server:

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

Your Library Management system should now be running locally at `http://localhost:8000/`.
